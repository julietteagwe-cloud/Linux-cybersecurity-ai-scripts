# Linux-cybersecurity-ai-scripts
Scripts from ChatGPT and  Microsoft Copilot for Linux Cybersecurity Assignment

 README — Cybersecurity Scripts (ChatGPT & Copilot)
Overview

This repository contains two cybersecurity scripts created using two different AI tools:

Script A — generated by ChatGPT

Script B — generated by Microsoft Copilot

Both scripts were manually typed into two servers:

Ubuntu server (user home directory /home/juliette)

CentOS server (root directory /root)

Each script performs different cybersecurity tasks on the server for learning 

Files in This Repository
1. Script A — ChatGPT_Cybersecurity_Short_A.sh

A simple, read-only cybersecurity audit.

Shows:

OS information

Kernel version

Login-capable users

SSH security settings

Firewall status (UFW or firewalld)

Listening ports

Does not make changes to the system.

2. Script B — Cybersecurity_B_Copilot.sh

A lightweight system hardening script.

Performs:

Firewall setup

Installs UFW on Ubuntu if needed

Uses firewalld on CentOS

SSH hardening (disables root login)

Lists login-capable users

Ensures safe defaults

This script modifies system settings.

3. /screenshots Folder

This folder contains all screenshots required for the assignment, including:

ChatGPT script running successfully on both servers

Copilot script showing errors

Screenshot of manual fixes (ARC fix, “TE” fix)

Final successful execution on Ubuntu

Final successful execution on CentOS

How the Scripts Were Obtained

Both scripts were created by giving prompts to:

ChatGPT (for Script A)

Microsoft Copilot (for Script B)

Afterwards, I typed both scripts manually into both servers.

 How to Transfer the Scripts Into the Servers

I typed the scripts manually into each server using:

nano ChatGPT_Cybersecurity_Short_A.sh
nano Cybersecurity_B_Copilot.sh


and saved them as executable files.

 How to Make the Scripts Executable

After typing each script, I ran:

chmod +x ChatGPT_Cybersecurity_Short_A.sh
chmod +x Cybersecurity_B_Copilot.sh

 How to Run the Scripts
Ubuntu Server

Ubuntu uses the home directory:

/home/juliette


To run:

./ChatGPT_Cybersecurity_Short_A.sh
sudo ./Cybersecurity_B_Copilot.sh

CentOS Server

CentOS stores files in:

/root


To run:

./ChatGPT_Cybersecurity_Short_A.sh
sudo ./Cybersecurity_B_Copilot.sh

Summary of My Manual Work (What I Did Myself)

My own contributions included:

Manually typing both AI-generated scripts into Ubuntu and CentOS

Fixing script errors:

awk bracket error

missing “tee” (TE merged incorrectly)

Testing scripts multiple times

Documenting every error and fix

Uploading scripts and screenshots into GitHub

Purpose of the Repository

This repository demonstrates:

Using two different AI tools to create cybersecurity scripts

Manual testing and troubleshooting on two servers

Comparing AI-generated output with required corrections

Providing screenshots for verification

Maintaining a clean, organized GitHub case study
